# Seaborn_Assingment

This project contains a collection of practice questions and solutions focused on seaborn, a Python data visualization library. It covers various examples that demonstrate how to create insightful visualizations, explore datasets, and analyze data trends using seaborn with supporting Python code.

Features

Visualize time series data comparing multiple lists using line plots.

Explore and understand inbuilt seaborn datasets like taxis with data inspections.

Create different types of plots including line plots, scatter plots, boxplots, histogram, and more.

Analyze relationships and distributions such as trip duration vs fare, distance vs fare, and payment tips.

Utilize pandas and matplotlib alongside seaborn for comprehensive data handling and visualization.

Detailed problem statements with step-by-step approaches and code implementations.

Dataset
The project primarily uses seaborn's inbuilt datasets for practice, such as the taxis dataset that contains taxi trip details including pickup/dropoff locations, fare, tip amount, and payment method.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Python (programming language)

Seaborn (data visualization)

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib (plot rendering)

How to Use
Clone this repository.

Ensure Python and required libraries (seaborn, pandas, matplotlib) are installed.

Open the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) and run cells to execute visualizations and analysis.

Follow the questions and code examples to learn seaborn plotting techniques and data exploration.

Objectives
Strengthen skills in data visualization with seaborn.

Understand how to apply seaborn plotting functions to real datasets.

Analyze and interpret visual data patterns for better insights.
